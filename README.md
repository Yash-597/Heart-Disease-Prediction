# Heart Disease Prediction with PyTorch

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using a neural network built with PyTorch. It uses a supervised machine learning approach on a structured dataset with medical attributes.

## Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis can save lives. In this project, a feed-forward neural network is trained on patient data to classify whether the person is likely to have heart disease.
